# Haskell Sort Function and Mixed Type Error

This example demonstrates a common error when using Haskell's `sort` function from `Data.List` with a list containing elements of different types that don't have a naturally defined ordering. The program attempts to sort a list containing both integers and strings, resulting in a runtime error.
